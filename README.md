# GroupBuy
GroupBuy allows vendors to sell set quantities of goods at a fixed price. By predicting supply, vendors will be able to offer discounts to buyers. 

Buyers are able to "pledge" to buy the goods they are interested in purchasing. Buyers are only charged when a good hits its target number of buyers. Buyers are willing to accept the delay associated with waiting for a product to reach its target because of the discounted price they pay for each product.

Purchase protection provided by GroupBuy instills security and trust in buyers and sellers.
